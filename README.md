# 💻Fake-Store QA Playground – API Checkout Tester 🛒

**Interactive AP I-first demo for exploring e-commerce checkout flows, assertions, and failure handling.**  

Test adding products to a cart, simulate checkout, handle failures, and see **live API responses with pass/fail assertions and timestamps** — all in a **visual, hands-on front-end app** designed for **QA demos, workshops, and presentations**.  

I intentionally kept the UI simple so the demo focuses on **API behavior, validation, and failure handling**.
